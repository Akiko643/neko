I have some expierence of gitlab (https://gitlab.com/n.nekogasuki643). So I know the way how to command from terminal so I tried to do this sort of things without terminal.
I just followed advance for regestering.
I was created repository when I was solving other task (Rust).
I clicked on the issues button then I found green "New issue" button. 
I wrote "dummy" on the title also comment side.
I have some c++ knowledge so hello world programming was easy. Also there was "create new file" button.
I found branch:master then I wrote new branch name on it.
I have used .gitignore file on local. Then I copied that file.
